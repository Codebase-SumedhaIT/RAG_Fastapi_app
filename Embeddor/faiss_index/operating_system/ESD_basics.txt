7.1 Padframes
Typically I/O pads are organized into a rectangular Padframe .
The smallest padframe available for the MOSIS chip fabrication
(http://www.mosis.org/ ), “TinyChip”, consists of 40 I/O pads, 10 on
each side. We use such a padframe in our practical exercises.
The complete documentation of the I/0 pads and resulting “TinyChip”
padframe for the TSMC0.35 technology is available from
http://www.mosis.org/cell-libraries/scn035-pads-tiny/mTSMs035P.pdf
Note that in the TSMC0.35 technology λ= 0.2µ.
The structure and dimensions of the TinyChip padframe in the
TSMC0.35 technology are given in Figure 7.1.

Note that the total size of the frame is 1.5 ×1.5mm2. The internal
space available for the core of the integrated circuit is 0.9 ×0.9mm2
which is equivalent to 4500×4500λ2.

The size of the bonding pad is 60 ×60µm2(3002λ2).
•ESD (electrostatic discharge) protecting circuitry consisting of a
pair of big pMOS, nMOS transistors.
The ESP circuitry takes twice the area of 78 ×78µm2(3902λ2).

An example of the layout of a TinyChip padframe consisting of
different I/O pads is given in Figure 7.3.
We note that in addition to different I/O pads, the padframe contains
four corner pads which close the VDD and GND connections.

7.2.1 Fundamentals of the ESD protection
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) occurs when the charge stored in the
human body or other devices is discharged to the gate of a MOS
transistor on contact or by static induction.
If, for example, the charge on the human body is discharged as a
current of 10 µA ﬂowing for 1 µs to a gate capacitor of Cg= 0.025pF,
then the voltage which will build up on the transistor gate is
V=10·10−6·10−6
0.025·10−12= 400 V
Such a voltage destroys MOS transistors, therefore, ESD protection is
essential for the I/O circuitry.
A typical solution of the ESD protection problem is to use clamping
diodes implemented using MOS transistors with gates tied up to either
GND for nMOS transistors, or to VDD for pMOS transistors as shown
in Figure 7.4.
For normal range of input voltages these transistors are in the off state.
If the input voltage builds up above (or below) a certain level, one of
the transistor starts to conduct clamping the input voltage at the save
level.
These clamping transistors are very big structures (in the example of
Figure 7.4 L= 2λ, W = 175 λ) consisting of a number of transistors
connected in parallel, and are able to sustain signiﬁcant current.

A single ESD protection transistor has a size of 3×175λ2. It can be
observed that the metal 2 layer is used to distribute VDD whereas the
metal 1 layer distributes the signal D. Note the contacts connecting the

7.2.3 The Latch-up Problem and its prevention
Large MOS transistor are susceptible to the latch-up effect.
In the chip substrate, at the junctions of the p and n material, parasitic
pnp and npn bipolar transistors are formed as in the following
cross-sectional view:
These bipolar transistors form a silicon-controlled rectiﬁer (SRC) with
positive feedback as in the following circuit model:
The ﬁnal result of the latch-up is the formation of a short-circuit (a low
impedance path) between VDD and GND which results in destruction
of the MOS transistor.

Guidelines for Avoiding Latch-Up
(Quoted from Kang, Leblebici)
•Usep+guard rings connected to ground around nMOS
transistors and n+guard rings connected to VDD around pMOS
transistors to reduce RwandRsuband to capture injected minority
carriers before they reach the base of the parasitic BJTs.
•Placesubstrateandwellcontactsascloseaspossibletothesource
connections of MOS transistors to reduce the values of Rwand
Rsub.
•Use minimum area p-wells (in case of twin-tub technology or
n-type substrate) so that the p-well photocurrent can be
minimized during transient pulses.
•Source diffusion regions of pMOS transistors should be placed so
that they lie along equipotential lines when currents ﬂow between
VDD and p-wells. In some n-well I/O circuits, wells are
eliminated by using only nMOS transistors.
•Avoid the forward biasing of source/drain junctions so as not to
inject high currents; the use of a lightly doped epitaxial layer on
top of a heavily doped substrate has the effect of shunting lateral
currents from the vertical transistor through the low- resistance
substrate.
•Lay out n- and p-channel transistors such that all nMOS
transistors are placed close to GND and pMOS transistors are
placed close to VDD rails. Also maintain sufﬁcient spacings
between pMOS and nMOS transistors.

IC design 7.3. OUTPUT PADS
7.3 Output pads
The simplest driver for the output pad consists of a pair of inverters
with large transistors (in addition to the standard ESD protection
circuitry).
The driver must be able to supply enough current (must have enough
driving capability) to achieve satisfactory rise and fall times ( tr, tf) for
a given capacitive load.
In addition the driver must meet any required DC characteristics
regarding the levels of output voltages for a given load type, namely,
CMOS or TTL.
