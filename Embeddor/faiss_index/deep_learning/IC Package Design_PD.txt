MCM / MCP
A Multi-Chip Module or MCM is a specialized 
electronic package where multiple Integrated 
Circuits (ICs), semiconductor dies or other modules 
are packaged in such a way as to facilitate their use
as a single IC.
Different Type of MCM
MCM-L - laminated MCM. The substrate is  a multi-layer laminated PCB (Printed 
circuit board). 
MCM-D - deposited MCM. The modules are deposited on the base substrate using 
thin film technology. 
MCM-C - ceramic substrate MCMs.
MCM-S - uses a silicon substrate with tracks  created in the silicon like regular ICs 

Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 131) IC Package Types (SiP / SoP)
SiP / SoP
The term “System in a Package” or SiP refers to 
a semiconductor device that incorporates multiple
chips and passives that make up a complete
electronic system into a single package.
Difference between SiP and SoC
SiP - Combines multiple chips and passives and encases them in to one package.
SoC - Builds multiple function-circuits on one chip.

Advantages :
Enormous installed capacity
Flexible process : multiple die / package
Dis-advantages :
Cost is a function of number of bonds
Wire inductance
Trend :
Pad pitch shrink is possible with new technology
Multiple rails to bond on a substrate

Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 336) Die to Package Bonding - TAB
Tape Automated Bonding (TAB)
TAB is the process of mounting a die on a flexible tape made of polymer material, 
such as polyimide. This can be mounted to a package substrate or PCB.
Thermo-compression bonding
Patterned metal on polymer tape is bonded
Advantages :
Gang bonding instead of single
Better electrical performance than a wire bond
Dis-advantages :
Each silicon requires a new tape design
Special metallurgy needed at the bond pad

Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 346) Die to Package Bonding - TAB
Tape Automated Bonding
Inner Lead Bonding (ILB)
The TAB bonds connecting the die and 
the tape are known as inner lead bonds.
Outer Lead Bonding (OLB)
The TAB bonds connecting the tape to the package or to external circuits are known 
as outer lead bonds.


Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 356) Die to Package Bonding – Flip Chip
Flip Chip Bonding
It is an interconnect technology [C4 Bu mp (Controlled Collapse Chip Connection)]
Can be offered in any type of pa ckage but it is most suited to BGA
Assembly Process :
Small bumps are grown on the die : Bumping
Die is flipped and attached  to the substrate : Reflow
Underfill to minimize CTE difference between the die and the substrate.
C4 Bump in the Die

Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 366) Die to Package Bonding – Flip Chip
Flip Chip Bonding
Advantages :

Assembly cost independent of No of I/Os
Dis-advantages :
Requires technology deve lopment in several areas
Required infrastructure is not there
Cost is very high for low volume applications
Expertise concentrated within certain companies
Additional fab processes - R edistribution, Bumping

6) Die to Package Bonding – Flip Chip (RDL)
RDL (Re Distribution Layer)
A redistribution layer (RDL) is a routing layer of conductive metal within an IC that 
connects the die or solder bump to a connection point on an I/O driver.
RDL in Flip-chip
The RDL connects I/O Cells to the Bond Pad
Normally it will be the top metal layer

It is the process of grinding  the backside of the wafer to  the correct wafer thickness 
prior to assembly. It is also referred to as 'wafer thinning'.
Die Preparation
Die preparation is the process by which the wafer is processed into individual dice in 
preparation for assembly.   Die preparation co nsists of two major steps, namely, wafer 
mounting and wafer saw.
Wafer Saw
Wafer saw is the step that actually cuts the wafer into individual dice for assembly in IC

Bond Lifting
Bond lifting refers to any of severa l phenomena in which a wire bond 
that connects the device to the ou tside world becomes detached from 
its position, resulting in loss or  degradation of electrical and
mechanical connection between th at bond and its bonding site.
Bond Shorting
Bond Shorting is the presence of an unintended electrical connection 
between two bonds.
Package Cracking
Package cracking is the occurrence of  fracture(s) anywhere in or on 
a semiconductor package.
Cratering
Cratering is a partial or total fracture  of the silicon material underneath 
the bond pad.  Cratering is commonly due to excessive stresses on the 
bond pads from a poorly set up wire-bonding machine.
Die Lifting
Die lifting is the dis-bonding or de tachment of the die from its die
pad or die cavity. 


Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 63Package Related Failures
Contamination
Contamination is the presence of a foreign material, whether attached
or unattached, anywhere inside or external portions of the package
and leads.
Package Chip-outs
Package chipping is a failure me chanism wherein a part or parts 
of the package break away  from the package itself.
Corrosion
Corrosion refers to the corrosion of the metal areas on the surface 
of the die or wire-bond or package leads. 
Package De-lamination
Package de-lamination refers to  the dis-bonding between a
surface of the package and that of another material.
Wire Depression
Wire depression is a condition wher ein one or more wires of the 
device are deformed or pressed downwards.  Wire depression is 
caused by purely mechanical me ans, usually by mishandling.

Wipro Confidential 1/03/2007 - page 65Eco Friendly Packaging
Eco Friendly Packaging
Eco packaging targets to use environmental friendly substances in the packaging 
and assembly process. It also targets to limit the hazardous su bstance to a minimum 
level in the packaging process.
Pb Free
For Pb free Pb must be reduced below a ce rtain level. In addition the package must 
survive Pb free assembly processes.
RoHS
ROHS, which is the acronym for "Reduc tion of Hazardous Substances", is a 
directive from the European Union (EU) that restricts the use of six substances 
[Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), Cadmium (Cd), etc.] in new electrical and electronic 
equipment that are placed on the market by July 1, 2006.
Green Packaging
The “Green” level packaging encompasses an even wider range of restrictions, and 
the requirements vary from region to  region and customer to customer.
